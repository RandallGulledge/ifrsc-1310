    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is a good source to use for any website and it has a lot of good content, presentation, and client-side scripting. Just as the article compared Progressive Enhancement to a Peanut M&M it shows how it really works. The content is solid, the presentation is rich, and the client-side scripting tops it off. Overall it is a great source to use but it does have its limits and should be improved to give more emphasis on CSS and JavaScript than HTML. I think the content is great and does a good job of how much work was put into it. CSS and JavaScript are good too and have good taste in their designs but only use a small part of it to make them better.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>The feedback I got from a friend that I got to know this semester was helpful in what he noticed. One thing he pointed out was that I needed to practice more on the base structure of CSS and go to the website that gives practice examples. This was a big help and gave me assurance in my skills and now I can do more than I thought I would be able to even search links to the potential problem. I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. CSS is a style sheet language and is used to describe the presentation of a document that is written in a type of languages like HTML or XML. JavaScript is also JS, a language of programming that is part of the core technologies of the world wide web. I learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed the class from each section I learned about. I did well in making sure that I followed the instructions and put them into practice in my code. If I had to start over I would probably spend more time making sure I understand the base structure and practice as much as I need to to be able to use it proficiently. I made sure to seek help when I needed it and took time to make sure I understood it. Even though I did not understand everything I tried my best and kept moving forward.</p>
